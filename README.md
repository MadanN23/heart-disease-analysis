# 🫀 Heart Disease Analysis — Power BI Project

## 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing heart disease survival trends using **Excel for data cleaning** and **Power BI for visualization**. Key health indicators like survival rate, serum creatinine, ejection fraction, and the effects of smoking, diabetes, and high blood pressure were examined through interactive dashboards.

## 📊 Project Type

**Excel (Data Cleaning) + Power BI (Visualization)**

---

## 📝 Description

The project uses the dataset **`heart_Disease_clinical_records`** to clean and prepare data for analysis in Power BI. Several **DAX measures and calculated fields** were created to derive key performance indicators (KPIs), including:

* **Survival Rate**
* **Average Age of Survival**
* **Total Survival Count**
* **Total Death Count**

Additional visual insights were developed for:

* **Survival Count and Average Serum Creatinine by Age Group**
* **Survival Count and Average Ejection Fraction by Age Group**
* **Survival Rate by Age Group**
* **Impact of Smoking, High Blood Pressure, Anaemia, and Diabetes by Age Group**

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

* **Microsoft Excel** – Data cleaning and preprocessing
* **Microsoft Power BI** – Dashboard creation and DAX-based analysis

---

## 🎯 Output / Key Results

The dashboard highlights:

* **Survival Rate:** 67.89%
* **Average Age of Survival:** 58.76 years
* **Total Deaths:** 96
* **Total Survivals:** 203
* Trends in **serum creatinine**, **ejection fraction**, and **comorbidities** across age groups

The visualization helps identify age groups with higher survival probabilities and understand how lifestyle and health factors influence heart disease outcomes.

## ⚙️ How to Reproduce / View Dashboard

Follow these steps to view or recreate the **Heart Disease Analysis** project:

1. **Download the files** from this repository:

   * `heart_Disease_clinical_records.xlsx`
   * `Heart_Disease_Analysis.pbix`

2. **Open the dataset** in **Microsoft Excel** to explore or clean the raw data (if needed).

3. **Open Power BI Desktop** and load the `.pbix` file:

   * Go to **File → Open → Browse** and select `Heart_Disease_Analysis.pbix`.
   * Check that the data source is linked to `heart_Disease_clinical_records.xlsx`.
   * If the file path is different, go to **Home → Transform Data → Data Source Settings → Change Source**, and update it with your local path.

4. **Refresh the data** in Power BI to ensure all visualizations and DAX measures update correctly.

5. **Explore the dashboard** by using interactive visuals to analyze survival trends, serum creatinine levels, ejection fractions, and comorbidity impacts across age groups.
